# ðŸ“œ get_next_line

## Description
**get_next_line** is a function that reads a line from a file descriptor until a newline character or the end of the file is reached.

## Usage
1. Clone this repo on your machine.
2. Create a text file in the same directory as the project. You can name it anything you like `example.txt`.
3. Replace `"lorem.txt"` in the main() inside of `get_next_line.c` with the name of your text file.
4. Compile the project using `cc get_next_line.h get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c`.

## Grade
